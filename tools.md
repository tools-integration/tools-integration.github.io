## Tools

[back](./)

* [Darshan][Darshan]: a scalable HPC I/O characterization tool. Darshan is
  designed to capture an accurate picture of application I/O behavior,
  including properties such as patterns of access within files, with
  minimum overhead.
* [Dyninst][Dyninst]: Dyninst is an API and related library for the dynamic
  instrumentation of binaries. It allows programs to be modified during
  execution without recompilation or re-linking. Used by performance
  measurement and other tools.
* [HPCToolkit][HPCToolkit]: HPCToolkit is an integrated suite of tools for
  measurement and analysis of program performance on computers ranging from
  multicore desktop systems to GPU-accelerated supercomputers. By using
  statistical sampling of timers and hardware performance counters on CPUs,
  HPCToolkit collects accurate measurements of a program's CPU work, resource
  consumption, and inefficiency and attributes them to the full calling
  context in which they occur.
* [PAPI][PAPI]: The Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI)
  offers a universal interface and methodology for gathering performance
  counter information from diverse hardware and software components. 
* [TAU][TAU]: TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) is capable of gathering
  performance information through instrumentation of functions, methods,
  basic blocks, and statements as well as event-based sampling.
